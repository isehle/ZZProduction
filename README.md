ZZProduction
==========

This is a clone of the ZZAnalysis repository that is meant to be used *only* for job submission to HTCondor; see the [Submitting Jobs](https://github.com/CJLST/ZZAnalysis/wiki/SubmittingJobs) Wiki of the original CJLST for more details. This repository tracks [ZZAnalysis](https://github.com/isehle/ZZAnalysis), which is a modified version of the original CJLST designed for inclusive ZZ production and the measurement of their polarization fractions. It is convenient to have a separate repo for job submission so that one can edit scripts while submitted jobs are in an idle state——see [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64333100/code-updates-during-submission-of-condor-jobs) for more information.
